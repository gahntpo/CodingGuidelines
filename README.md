# CodingGuidelines
Example refactoring for better coding 

If you want to improve your code, try to do this things:
- Naming for clarity
- Extract functions to clarify purpose of logic
- Rethink where code should live 
- Be consistent in your naming and file structure
- Use positive names isActive and not isInactive
- when you are confused or need to think about a certain part in the codebase, try to improve it for more clarity

This is the playground I wrote for a Youtube tuturial. You can find it here:
